# SeniorStories
This is a project where I used Python (implementing the Django framework) in order to create a website for the community.
I made a website where seniors in my local community can share their life stories and experiences with each other.

Please note that this was heavily influenced by Corey Schafer's Django tutorial. I followed through the series, but made improvements where I saw fit, such as changing the entire registration form (to include fields that I needed), voiding the password security that requires a certian number of characters, symbols, etc., and changed the CSS as well. Throughout the series, I also changed my code from the tutorial to make it moer concise or expansive, depending on what I needed for my personal project. This was deployed onto PythonAnywhere.
