# SeniorStories
This is a project where I used Python (implementing the Django framework) in order to create a website for the community.
I made a website where seniors in my local community can share their life stories and experiences with each other.

Please note that this was influenced by Corey Schafer's Django tutorial that sparked the idea to bring my idea to life using Django. Some things I learned in this project include:

* Registration forms
* Django Admin
* Basic user authentication using Python
* Implementing password security (basic requirements) 
* Django templates
* Deploying projects to PythonAnywhere
